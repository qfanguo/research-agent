    "summary": "<p>Hi HN!<p>I've been building this solo for about three and a half years. I kept trying every new project/notes tool (Notion, Asana, Trello, etc.) and always ended up back in a plain text file. I wanted something that felt like a text editor on first touch but could grow into real structure when you needed it.<p><a href=\"https://lightwave.so\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lightwave.so</a> (desktop only)<p>The tech stack is Laravel, MySQL, Redis, and hand-rolled JavaScript on the client. No frameworks like React/Vue/etc. ~270 lines of jQuery (out of 80k+ total LOC) for a few legacy DOM utilities, plus IndexedDB for local persistence. Real-time collaboration uses a hybrid approach: HTTP/2 POST for resilient ops + WebSockets via Laravel Reverb for live cursors, presence, and edits.<p>This is a pre-release stress test, not a launch. Lightwave will be a paid product. Right now I'm opening it up because no amount of solo testing replicates getting punched in the mouth by real traffic.<p>The link above has a button to create a test account in 1 click.<p>Known rough edges: the cursor and selection system are built from scratch (like VS Code, not a contenteditable wrapper), so there's a lot of surface area. Some keyboard shortcuts may be missing. Desktop only, accessibility not yet implemented. I'm shipping fixes in real time.<p>There's a \"Submit Bug or Feedback\" button inside the app if something breaks. Happy to answer any questions about the architecture, or anything else.<p>Some highlights:<p>- Paste markdown in, get native blocks. Copy blocks out, get markdown back.<p>- Hierarchical document, structure. Hierarchichal file manager.<p>- Live collab with shared cursors, selection, and presence.<p>- Code blocks with syntax highlighting. LaTeX math blocks.<p>- Full data export: markdown, JSON, and attachments. No lock-in.<p>- Full undo/redo with cursor restoration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47027463\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47027463</a></p>\n<p>Points: 46</p>\n<p># Comments: 29</p>",
